<p>Manipur has been known through the ancient and medieval times through Meetei manuscripts as one of the richest intellectual heritage in Southeast Asia, with roots equidistant from the Indus Valley Civilization in the west and the Hango Ho Civilization to the far-east – the account of its land, people and civilization stretching two millennia. At the crossroads of Asian economic and cultural exchange, Manipur has long connected the Indian subcontinent to Asia enabling migration of people and religions. There is great cultural diversity where various ethnicities have coexisted since ages.</p>

<p>It was the Kingdom of Manipur which during the 20th century joined India after its independence. This however has been contested by groups and has resulted in a 50 year insurgency in the state where lives have been lost and development halted. The recent decade has seen better days though and travelers can today access various areas safely.</p>

<p>The Meetei peoples are the main ethnic community of the state, along with other tribal groups such as Kukis and Tangkhul. The people of the state are primely into agriculture and forest based sustainable livelihoods.</p>

<p>The oval-shaped state has an exotic landscape with gentle blue hills, lush valleys, lakes, plentiful rivers and deep forests. Literally meaning the ‘land of jewel’, nature has been kind in her beauty here. In the large freshwater Loktak Lake, we can see midst the labyrinthine of boat routes and colorful water plants, small islands that are rich floating biomass on which lake-dwellers live in homes. The Loktak landscape is also the only floating national park of the world, known dearly for Sangai deer which are endemic here. While on the other side on Manipur is Dzukou, a rolling valley covered with an immaculate bamboo forest.</p>

<p>Manipur is truly off the beaten track, a cultural treasure trove set amidst splendid and simple natural beauty. Secrets lie plenty here, such as the perfectness of the classical Manipuri Dance, the roots of Polo gaming history, the Ima market in Imphal run by more than thousand women, the numerous non-touristy festivals, or the border town of Moreh from where we can escape to the secrets of mainland Southeast Asia.</p>
