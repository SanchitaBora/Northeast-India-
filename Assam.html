<p>Assam shares a boundary with all the states of Northeast India and serves as a doorway to the secrets of the seven sisters. This land has its deepest roots to the mighty Brahmaputra River which overpowers the landscape and has shaped both culture and the environment. Assam is renowned over the world for its tea plantations and also as a delicate interconnected hotspot of cultures, wildlife and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Dispur is the capital of Assam and is a suburb of Guwahati, the largest city in the region that connects mainland India to the northeastern frontier. Guwahati is a historic city of the Brahmaputra river civilization and is most important commercial centre for the region. Other important urban areas such as Dibrugarh, Jorhat, Tinsukia and Tezpur emerged due to the growth of tea industry and oil refineries in the region. Most of the human habitation is located along the fertile plains of the Brahmaputra river where the people live simple lives in small cities, towns and villages.</p>
<p>The Ahom kingdom (1228–1826), in the Brahmaputra Valley in Assam , is well known for maintaining its sovereignty for nearly 600 years and successfully resisting Mughal expansion in Northeast India. Established by Sukaphaa, a Tai prince from Mong Mao, it began as a mong in the upper reaches of the Brahmaputra based on wet rice agriculture. It expanded suddenly under Suhungmung in the 16th century and became multi-ethnic in character, casting a profound effect on the political and social life of the entire Brahmaputra valley.</p>
<p>Lachit Borphukan was a commander and Borphukan (Phu-Kon-Lung) in the Ahom kingdom, known for his leadership in the 1671 Battle of Saraighat that thwarted a drawn-out attempt by Mughal forces under the command of Ramsingh-I to take over Ahom kingdom.</p>
<p>From wild habitats to ancient temples of mysticism, shrines and unique monastical practices, villages of well preserved indigenous cultures, colorful festivals and a large hospitable population, Assam is a prefect tourist destination with plenty of attractions and mysteries.It is the home to the majestic one horned rhinoceros.The great nobleman Swami Vivekananda once must have rightfully said “Next only to Kashmir, Assam is the most beautiful place in India.</p>
