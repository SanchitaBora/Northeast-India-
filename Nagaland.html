<p>The mountainous state of Nagaland is located on the eastern boundary of Northeast India bordering the Kingdom of Myanmar and remains home to the sixteen Naga tribes, each with distinct culture, tribal traditions and language. It is a land of festivals and folklore that have been passed down for generations. Nagaland has always attracted numerous visitors and curious anthropologists from around the world, who have come to learn more about the tribal lifestyles of these once-headhunters. Nagaland hosts the popular Hornbill Festival every year in December, which is one of the biggest tourism event in the Indian subcontinent.</p>

<p>Not much is known about the history of the earlier times of the Naga people and their land. The ancient Hindu text Mahabharata has reference of the ogress Hidimba after which Dimapur was named. Dimapur was the first capital of Dimasa Kachari civilization on the banks of Dhansiri river during antiquity, few monolithic carvings and historical ruins still remain. The Dimasas often faced raids from the hill tribes and eventually shifted their capital in the middle ages. The British explorers reached the Naga Hills in 19th century with the hope of baptizing the natives and finding a new route to Burma. Their expeditions faced resistance from the Angami tribe of Khonoma village and their missionary activities were protested by the Zeliangrong tribe. The Naga Hills came into importance during World War II when the Japanese invaded India to overthrow the empire. The Japanese aimed to reach Dimapur rail line and cut off British supplies to Imphal airfields by capturing Kohima ridge. The Imperial Japanese Army entered the Naga Hills and captured Kohima after a fierce fighting took place. Their defeat at Kohima changed the course of the war. The tribal hill tract of Naga Hills was later carved out of Assam and made a new state named Nagaland. The Nagas however from observations are much unlike mainland Indians and have always considered themselves to be the owner and governor of their land.And their dream of Nagalim, a Naga nation unites them.</p>

<p>Kohima is the capital of Nagaland and is better known as the venue of the Hornbill Festival. It is also a historic town which witnessed important battles of the Second World War. Dimapur, located at the foothills, is the largest town of Nagaland. Dimapur is a commercial centre and is well connected with other towns in the region. It also connects Nagaland with other parts of India with regular air and rail services. Wokha and Mokokchung in western Nagaland were the first towns in the Naga hills to be established by the British. Small towns such as Mon and Tuensang in eastern Nagaland are significant cultural centers where it is still possible to meet some of the tattooed headhunters and listen to their stories of deadly savage escapades.</p>

<p>Many remote parts of Nagaland can be considered as the wild eastern frontier of India as these places have been explored only in recent times. The beauty of Nagaland can be seen in the lofty mountains of Japfu mountain, mesmerizing Dzukou valley, forested Patkai hills and also in the tribal villages. Many Nagas still preserve their old traditions and remains of their indigenous culture. Though the people were brave warriors in the past, they are now warm hosts to the visitors</p>
