<h2>Assamese Cuisine :</h2>
<p>Assamese food is mainly based on rice and fish. For dessert, or for those with a sweet tooth, there is a wide range in "pithas" (cakes).

Rice is the staple diet in Assam and is eaten in various forms throughout the day. The Assamese eat a huge variety of rice-based breakfast cereals with milk, yoghurt or thick cream­akhoi (puffed rice), chira (chura), muri, komal chaul (a specially processed rice which doesnot require cooking but just an hour's soak in cold water) and hurum to name but a few. Normally jaggery or sugar is added but for those who prefer savoury items, salt can be added. Also there are the various kinds of pitha that are prepared from rice powder.

Authentic Assamese cuisine is bland and yet very delicious. Very little oil is used and practically no spices. All Assamese people are non-vegetarian. There are some, who may not eat meat , but it’s difficult to find anyone who does not eat fish and duck’s eggs. Mustard oil is used for cooking and occasionally clarified butter or ghee.</p>

<h2> Nagamese Cuisine :</h2>
<p>There are sixteen main tribes of Nagaland and each of them has a distinct style of cooking which makes Naga cuisine very, very wide-ranged.

Although Naga cuisine is primarily non-vegetarian and includes a wide variety of meats, often exotic, like frogs, snails, dogs, cat and even, elephant, vegetables (primarily, bamboo shoots, lettuce, soya beans, mustard leaves, yam leaves) are also included in the cooking. Apart from meat, they also eat fish, dry fish, crabs, spiders, earthworms and bee larvae.

Usually, their cuisine is very hot and spicy and is famous for the use of Bhut Jolokia or Ghost Chilli or Naga King Chilli for which the government of Nagaland has acquired the GI rights. The Nagamese use less oil in their preparations and rather depend on fermentation and like to dry and smoke their meat and fish. Hunting is a very traditional pastime of the Nagamese and it becomes evident from it why meat-consumption is so integral to their food habit.</p>
